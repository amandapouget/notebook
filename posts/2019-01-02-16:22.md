# Review: Rotherweird

Fun, imaginative urban fantasy fiction. Extremely English, in a good way,
harking back to Miss Marple and cobblestones without being crypto-fascist.
Strongly influenced by Gormenghast, but without being pretentious or
modernist. I found it slightly tricky to keep track of characters and clues.
Looking forward to reading _Wyntertide_.
