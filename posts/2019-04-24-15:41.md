# Renaming things is hard

It's often commented that [naming things is
hard](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html). That's true. A
good name succinctly captures the essential details of a thing in a way that
distinguishes it from all other things and that is instantly recognizable to
many.

But that's not so much of problem.

The real problem is that _renaming_ things is hard. A name is a reference that
is used everywhere, by beings and programs outside your control and outside
your knowledge. When you change something's name, you have to find everything
that refers to it and change them. This is a lot of work and not always
possible.

Because renaming things is hard, and we all _know_ that renaming things is
hard, we try really hard to get names right the first time. This is
commendable, but it also makes naming things feel harder.

Worse still, the point when we name a thing is often when we know the least
about it. Before the blank file comes the blank filename prompt.

I don't know what we can do about this, other than build better tools to make
renaming things easier. But if you're in a position to be doing that, you
should probably be giving me advice.
