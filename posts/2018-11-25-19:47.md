# Review: Lies Sleeping, Ben Aaronovitch

Spoiler free.

The latest book in the _Rivers of London_ series. I really enjoyed it. I can
increasingly see why people compare the series to the Laundry Files or the
Dresden Files, but this, honestly, is vastly better written and better
crafted.

I read the ebook, but in my head I heard the voices as read by Kobna
Holdbrook-Smith, who reads the audio books and is really very good at it.

For me, one of the highlights of the book was an anti-London rant from a major
character. It came as a refreshing change of perspective.

I feel like this one lacked some of the humour and warmth of others in the
series. There are good reasons for that, but I missed it nevertheless.
