# New beginnings

I want to create a new space where I can write about stuff that I find
interesting, without having to think at all about the intended audience.

I want the barrier to posting to be very low, which means it has to be easy
for me to write and publish something at a technical level, and also that the
quality expectations are fairly low.

I've been inspired by [DRMacIver's notebook](https://notebook.drmaciver.com),
which gets a prodigious amount of postings.

There's going to be a mix of stuff here, running a spectrum of work stuff and
personal stuff. I'll probably also copy David's "attention conservation
notice" and "epistemic status" tricks, more for my own benefit than yours.

I expect this will completely replace my old personal blog, [Echo and
Bounce](https://life.jml.io). I'd like to merge the two, but I just don't have
the time. I still intend to post to my professional blog at
[jml.io](https://jml.io/blog/), but the things there will be a bit less raw.
