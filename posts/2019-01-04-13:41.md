# Sidenotes support

I've finally got around to implementing
[sidenotes](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#sidenotes) support for
this blog.

My first approach was to copy and paste footnotes extension that comes with
markdown, and then modify it to suit. Unfortunately, this reached a dead end
fairly quickly. I found the module to complex to be able to pare it down to
what I needed.

In particular, the extension has a strangely complex way of dealing with
multiple references to the same footnote. This isn't a feature that I intend
to use, and even if I do, I'd implement it quite differently.

So, in the end, I started a new extension that's heavily inspired by the
original, re-using it's Markdown syntax parsers for identifying sidenote
definitions and replacing sidenote references.

It could probably be made nicer, but it works enough for now. I haven't
implemented margin notes, as I can't be bothered thinking of a Markdown syntax
for them, and I have no real desire for them anyway.

One nice side effect of this change is that it fixes the problem where
footnote links weren't working on the main index page. There aren't links any
more, so they can't link to the wrong place.

If you want to use this sidenotes extension, be sure to add a `counter-reset:
sidenote-counter` to your `h2` styles.
