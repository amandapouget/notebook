# # Review: 100 Ways to Improve Your Writing

Highly recommend this book to everyone.

I didn't buy this book for me. I bought it for an acquaintance who writes
badly, and thought the least I could do is read it before I smack them over
the head with it. I'm glad I did.

_100 Ways to Improve Your Writing_ is a short, punchy book with lots of
excellent, practical advice about how to write better. Unlike _Elements of
Style_, it is not patronizing and not over-prescriptive.

Although many of the examples are focused on journalistic writing, Provost is
keen to frame writing in the broadest possible context. Writing is a way of
getting what you want, and you are more likely to get what you want if you
write well.

Each chapter focuses on a theme, like "Six Ways to Avoid Punctuation Errors"
or "Twelve Ways to Avoid Making Your Reader Hate You". Each "way" is short,
and comes with concrete examples.

I suspect the best way to use this book is to pick one tip to work on and
engage in some [deliberate
practice](https://notes.jml.io/posts/2019-01-02-13:58.html). I certainly would
like to do so.

I have been reminded that I always have something to learn. More than that,
that believing I already know it all is a great way to learn nothing, and
conversely, that believing I have something to learn is a great way to learn
more.
