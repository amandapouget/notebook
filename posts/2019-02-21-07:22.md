# Blogging from my work laptop

New job at [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) is great. Although there's a
lot to do, and a bunch of genuine challenges, the overall environment is very
healthy and supportive, and the culture is one of trust, learning, candour,
and gumption.

I've finally grabbed a few moments to do some tweaks to my work laptop (e.g.
set up kubernetes bash completion). You can check these out here:

Also, I think I've set it up so I can write to my notebook. This is actually a
test post.
