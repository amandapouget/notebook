# Review: A Wrinkle in Time

One of the tragedies of my current flat is that I have not organized our
books. Normally, I have all the books in their proper place, with a proper
system, but for whatever reason our books at home remain unorganized. So, it
happens that _A Wrinkle in Time_ has been at my eye level in a place I wait a
lot for months now.

After reading _So You Want To Be A Wizard_, I thought I'd give _Wrinkle_ a
try. Jolie has recommended Madeleine L'Engle to me before, and I vaguely
recalled there'd been a film of it, and I was in the mood for something that
would be entertaining, uplifting and unchallenging.

_A Wrinkle in Time_ was all of these things, but like _SYWTBAW_ it didn't grab
my heart. I'm just too old.

It's also coming from a place that I find a bit odd. At one point, it's
revealed that all of creation is singing of the glory of the LORD in words
that might have been taken from the Psalms, but later Jesus is put on the same
level as Beethoven.

I don't know that I would recommend the book. I think I would suggest to
certain young adults as a thing to try.
