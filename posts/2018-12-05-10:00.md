# Review: So You Want to be a Wizard

I reached out for this book because I was feeling pretty glum, and wanted the
solace of some good YA fiction: adventure, hope, nothing too grim, and home in
time for tea.

_So You Want to be a Wizard_ provided all of that (a welcome relief!), but
isn't going to stand out as an all time fave. It's got a kind of heavy
handedness that I think I would have appreciated had I read it when I was ten
or eleven, but find a bit plodding now.

For example, Nita's good with plants and Kit's good with machines. Nita
consciously notices this several times, and wonders if those will be their
respective specialties. It's the sort of thing I thought a lot as a thirteen
year old (alas, my specialty in wizardry has yet to reveal itself), but as
someone in my mid-thirties, I don't need to be told, and when I am, I want to
take Nita gently aside and tell her that "You're essentially X, and I am
essentially Y" thoughts are just not helpful.

Points awarded for a magical, dearly loved city, even if it's the wrong city.
Also for good, no big deal, character diversity.

Nita's "If" at the end is a very powerful idea that I wish were executed
better. I hope the sequels make more of this, but I'm not going to rush to
find out.

I think I'll dip into Madeleine L'Engle next time I want to read YA. Until
then, I'll continue to heartily recommend Diana Wynne Jones, and keep this one
as a backstop.
